Words in context

https://vi4.ilovetranslation.com/W6ivWZ50b7l=d/

Yoko is having trouble with seasonal /ˈsiː.zən.əl/ allergies /ˈæl.ɚ.dʒi/ this fall.
After consulting with her doctor, they decide she should take medication /ˌmed.əˈkeɪ.ʃən/ on a regular basis to control her symptoms /ˈsɪmp.təm/.
Her doctor recommends /ˌrek.əˈmend/ the medication he thinks will work best and offers her a handful /ˈhænd.fʊl/ of samples at no charge /tʃɑːrdʒ/.
For her long-term needs, Yoko will need to have a prescription  /prɪˈskrɪp.ʃən/ filled.
Her doctor volunteers to call the pharmacy /ˈfɑːr.mə.si/.
Yoko uses to order a supply, which will limit the time she spends waiting for the prescription to be filled.

Yoko is new in town and does not know which pharmacy she wants to use.
She knows that there is a drugstore /ˈdrʌɡ.stɔːr/ near her apartment and one near where she works, but does not remember the operating hours for either.
Yoko knows that convenient hours and location are important factors in selecting a pharmacy.
Although she can fill different prescriptions at different drugstores, it makes more sense to Yoko to fill all of her medications at one location.

Occasionally  /əˈkeɪ.ʒən.əl.i/, some drugs will have harmful /ˈhɑːrm.fəl/ interactions.
Usually, your doctor will prevent a drug interaction problem before it starts.
But, if you see more than one doctor, it is hard to monitor /ˈmɑː.nə.t̬ɚ/ the various medications you are taking.
Having all your prescriptions filled at one location increases the chances that the pharmacist /ˈfɑːr.mə.sɪst/ will detect a potential drug interation problem.
This timely /ˈtaɪm.li/ detection can save your life.
