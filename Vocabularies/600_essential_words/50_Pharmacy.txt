Words in context

https://vi4.ilovetranslation.com/W6ivWZ50b7l=d/

Yoko is having trouble with seasonal allergies this fall.
After consulting with her doctor, they decide she should take medication on a regular basis to control her symptoms.
Her doctor recommends the medication he thinks will work best and offers her a handful of samples at no charge.
For her long-term needs, Yoko will need to have a prescription filled.
Her doctor volunteers to call the pharmacy.
Yoko uses to order a supply, which will limit the time she spends waiting for the prescription to be filled.

Yoko is new in town and does not know which pharmacy she wants to use.
She knows that there is a drugstore near her apartment and one near where she works, but does not remember the operating hours for either.
Yoko knows that convenient hours and location are important factors in selecting a pharmacy.
Although she can fill different prescriptions at different drugstores, it makes more sense to Yoko to fill all of her medications at one location.

Occasionally, some drugs will have harmful interactions.
Usually, your doctor will prevent a drug interaction problem before it starts.
But, if you see more than one doctor, it is hard to monitor the various medications you are taking.
Having all your prescriptions filled at one location increases the chances that the pharmacist will detect a potential drug interation problem.
This timely detection can save your life.
